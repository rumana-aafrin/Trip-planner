       <p> It’s better to visit italy during spring season. You can cover important places in 3 days if you are visiting Italy during an extended weekend. Of course, it is not even enough if you want to see everything in Rome itself. 
The most important cities are Rome, Vatican and Venice. For travelling in Rome and Vatican, take buses and trains. and for Venice take public boats. There are also water taxi's available, but they cost expensive.</p>

        <p>This is the dream city to visit for many of us. You wonder how buildings float in the water. Here you visit Piazza di san Marco called as St. Mark’s square for the sunrise. It’s wonderful to see at that time. There are lot of islands and interconnecting bridges in Venice. You should visit <strong class="highlight">Glass bridge.</strong> It is made up of strong glass. Book your hotels near the sea sites.</p>
